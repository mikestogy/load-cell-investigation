# load-cell-investigation

The purpose of this project is to investigate strain gauge load cells. While there are no specific goals for the project, I ultimatley want to see how accuratley and how fast I can read them.

So far I have experimented with the on-board differential ADC of the ATMEGA2560, TI ADS1115 ADC, and TI ADS1015 ADC
