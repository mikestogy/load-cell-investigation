# load-cell-investigation

The purpose of this project is to investigate strain gauge load cells. While there are no specific targets for the project, improving speed and accuracy in readings is the main goal. Ultimatley, this information will be used for other projects where measuring impulse becomes valuable (rockets, recoil, impacts, etc).

Information within consists of arduino code to read the load cell on various devices, python programs to visaluize and process the data, and (hopefully) detailed writeups on the operation, collection, and analyzation of device and collected data.

So far the data will cover the following ADC's/load cell boards:

-HX711 Load Cell Board

-ATMEGA2560 build-in ADC

-Texas Insturments ADS1115 ADC

-Texas Insturments ADS1015 ADC
